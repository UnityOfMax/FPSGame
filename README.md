This is a first person shooter game (unfinished).

This taught me about dynamic updates, player movement, 3D game dev and optimising for more realistic feeling

To add:
 - Inventory, visual ability to see what slot the player is in
 - Variations of enemies
 - Multiplayer 
(- Player skins and better gun models, to develop CAD skills)
